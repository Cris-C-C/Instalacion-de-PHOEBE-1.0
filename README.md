# PHOEBE 1.0 Installation in Ubuntu or Linux-Mint
PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) is software designed to enhance and extend the Wilson–Devinney model. It is widely used in astronomy for the detailed analysis of the structure, properties, and evolution of eclipsing binary systems. Although PHOEBE has been updated over the years to version 2.4, its use can be complex for new users, as it is entirely implemented in Python. For this reason, using version 1.0 of PHOEBE proves more accessible, as it offers the convenience of a graphical interface (GUI), facilitating a more practical approach to the analysis of these systems. However, due to its discontinuation, associated with the age of this version, this tutorial is provided with the aim of facilitating its installation and utilization.


```bash
sudo apt update
```
